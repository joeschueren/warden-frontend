# Warden

Warden Finance is a finance and budgeting app. Users can track their transcations and see how much money they are spending on food, gas, and all of their expenses. I decided to make this app because I needed to track where my money was going to keep on top of my finances. It was created with React.js, PostgreSQL, Express.js, and Node.js

# Features

- Users create an account to track their data, uses session based authentication for smooth UX

- Dashboard for easy access to all of the sites features
- Gives insights on the user's past purchases for the month and the year
